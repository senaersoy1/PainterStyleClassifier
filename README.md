# 🎨 Painter Style Classification

This project implements a painting style classifier using machine learning. Images of classical paintings are processed and analyzed using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms.

The report includes:
- Dataset and preprocessing details
- PCA + k-NN model implementation
- Confusion matrix and classification results
- Stylistic analysis of external artists (Bouguereau, Gentileschi, Renoir)

## 🧠 Core Idea

The goal is to classify paintings by artist style:
- Training artists: Caravaggio, Cabanel, Monet  
- Test artists: Bouguereau, Gentileschi, Renoir  
Classification is done using image features such as color and texture.


## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3 and the following libraries are installed:
numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-learn
